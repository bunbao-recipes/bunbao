# Bunbao
Bunbao Web3 Framework

## Ideology / Motivation
Crypto and decentralized web is very attractive. Hundreds of developers daily joining the industry. They all have their ideas and most of them have almost no experience in web3 and most of them have junior skills in web2. TCP/IP, UDP, Reverse Proxy, Cache -  WTF it is? Lots of them thinks that they are frontend or backend developers without understanding that for Web3 there is no diffrence.

Bunbao is a comrehansive tool for this guys to rapidly build fast loading, extendable, secure prototypes of their ideas. And the one of the goals of Bunbao is that it's attended to to follow best practices and to be standards complaint. There is no pretty much special its just forces devs to not write bad code. So you don't need to became Bunbao programmer — Bunbao just forces you to be good javascript programmer and your code will be easily portable to the any other framework.

With Bao it's even no need to know what DevOps is. It's will setup everything for you from webserver to private nodes — just provide it with a credentials.

Matra: You need a month for prototype if you need 1 week to borrow money and buy laptop and week more to learn programming basics.
